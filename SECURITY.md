# Security Best Practices

This document covers the security measures I've implemented in this DevOps project. Security isn't an afterthought here - it's built into every layer of the system.

## Container Security

### Docker Security
I've hardened the Docker containers with several security measures:

- **Non-root user**: The container runs as user 1001, not root (because running as root is asking for trouble)
- **Minimal base image**: Using Alpine Linux for a smaller attack surface
- **Security audit**: `npm audit` runs during the build process to catch known vulnerabilities
- **Read-only filesystem**: The container filesystem is read-only to prevent runtime modifications
- **No unnecessary files**: Documentation and text files are removed to reduce the attack surface
- **Proper permissions**: Files have appropriate ownership and permissions set

### Image Security
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Trivy scans images in the CI/CD pipeline before deployment
- **Layer optimization**: Multi-stage builds reduce image size and remove build dependencies
- **Dependency management**: Only production dependencies are included in the final image

## Kubernetes Security

### Pod Security
I've configured the pods to run securely:

- **Security context**: Pods run as non-root with specific UID/GID
- **Privilege escalation**: Disabled (`allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`)
- **Capabilities**: All capabilities are dropped (no special privileges)
- **Read-only root filesystem**: Prevents runtime modifications to the container
- **Resource limits**: CPU and memory limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks

### Network Security
- **Network policies**: Micro-segmentation with ingress/egress rules
- **Service accounts**: Dedicated service accounts with minimal permissions
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control for Kubernetes resources

### Secrets Management
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Sensitive data is stored in AWS Secrets Manager, not in the code
- **IAM integration**: Pods use IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) for secure access
- **Least privilege**: Minimal permissions for secret access

## Application Security

### HTTP Security Headers
I've added security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables XSS filtering in browsers
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts resource loading to prevent XSS
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information sent to other sites

### Input Validation
- **JSON size limits**: Prevents large payload attacks
- **Error handling**: Proper error responses without exposing sensitive information
- **Health checks**: Secure health and readiness endpoints

## AWS Security

### IAM Security
- **Least privilege**: Minimal permissions for all roles (no more admin access for everything)
- **Service-specific roles**: Separate roles for cluster, nodes, and pods
- **No hardcoded credentials**: Uses IAM roles and instance profiles
- **Regular rotation**: Policies support credential rotation

### Network Security
- **VPC isolation**: Resources are in a private VPC
- **Security groups**: Restrictive inbound/outbound rules
- **Public subnets**: Only for load balancers and NAT gateways
- **Encryption in transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at rest**: EBS volumes are encrypted
- **Encryption in transit**: All data is encrypted in transit
- **Secrets encryption**: AWS Secrets Manager encryption
- **Log encryption**: CloudWatch logs are encrypted

## Monitoring & Compliance

### Security Monitoring
- **CloudWatch alarms**: Monitor for security events
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Automated container scanning
- **Access logging**: All API calls are logged
- **Audit trails**: CloudTrail for compliance

### Compliance
- **CIS benchmarks**: Follows CIS Kubernetes benchmarks
- **Security scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments
- **Policy enforcement**: Pod Security Policies (where supported)
- **Resource tagging**: Proper resource identification

## Incident Response

### Security Alerts
- **SNS notifications**: Email alerts for security events
- **CloudWatch alarms**: Real-time security monitoring
- **Automated responses**: Auto-scaling and health checks

### Recovery Procedures
- **Backup strategies**: EBS snapshots and ECR images
- **Disaster recovery**: Multi-AZ deployment
- **Rollback procedures**: Blue-green deployment ready

## Security Checklist

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time implementation. Regular reviews, updates, and monitoring are essential for maintaining a secure environment.
