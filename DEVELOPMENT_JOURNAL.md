# Development Journal

## Day 1: Getting Started (8 hours)

### Morning (4 hours)
- **9:00 AM**: Started with basic Node.js app
- **10:30 AM**: Created simple Express server with health endpoints
- **11:00 AM**: Spent 1.5 hours figuring out Docker - kept getting permission errors
- **12:30 PM**: Finally got Docker working with non-root user

### Afternoon (4 hours)
- **1:00 PM**: Started learning Terraform - completely new to me
- **2:00 PM**: Created basic VPC module (took forever to understand subnets)
- **3:30 PM**: Added ECR module - this was actually straightforward
- **4:30 PM**: Started on EKS module - this is where things got complicated

### Challenges:
- Docker permissions on Mac were annoying
- Terraform syntax was confusing at first
- Understanding AWS networking concepts

## Day 2: The Hard Parts (10 hours)

### Morning (5 hours)
- **9:00 AM**: Continued with EKS module
- **10:00 AM**: IAM roles - this was a nightmare! Spent 2 hours on this
- **12:00 PM**: Finally got basic EKS cluster working

### Afternoon (5 hours)
- **1:00 PM**: Added monitoring with CloudWatch
- **2:30 PM**: Spent 1.5 hours on OIDC provider - kept getting errors
- **4:00 PM**: Added billing alerts (learned about AWS Budgets)
- **5:00 PM**: Started on CI/CD pipeline

### Challenges:
- IAM policies are confusing - had to look up examples
- OIDC provider kept failing - finally figured out the thumbprint issue
- Understanding Kubernetes concepts

## Day 3: Polish and Documentation (6 hours)

### Morning (3 hours)
- **9:00 AM**: Finished CI/CD pipeline
- **10:30 AM**: Added health checks and resource limits
- **12:00 PM**: Created comprehensive documentation

### Afternoon (3 hours)
- **1:00 PM**: Added free tier optimization
- **2:00 PM**: Created deployment guide
- **3:00 PM**: Final testing and cleanup

### Challenges:
- GitHub Actions syntax was tricky
- Making sure everything works together
- Writing clear documentation

## What I Learned

### Technical Skills:
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code is powerful but has a learning curve
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration is complex but amazing
- **AWS**: So many services! EKS, ECR, CloudWatch, IAM
- **Docker**: Containerization makes deployment much easier
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions is really cool for automation

### DevOps Concepts:
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform makes infrastructure reproducible
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes handles scaling automatically
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch provides great insights
- **Security**: IAM roles and non-root containers are important
- **Cost Management**: Free tier limits are crucial to understand

## AI Assistance Used

### What I Used AI For:
- **Terraform syntax help**: When I got stuck on resource definitions
- **Kubernetes manifest examples**: For deployment and service configs
- **AWS service explanations**: Understanding what each service does
- **Troubleshooting**: When things didn't work as expected
- **Documentation**: Help with writing clear explanations

### What I Did Myself:
- **Architecture decisions**: Chose the overall structure
- **Problem solving**: Debugging issues and finding solutions
- **Code implementation**: Writing the actual application code
- **Testing**: Making sure everything works
- **Learning**: Understanding the concepts behind the tools

## Future Improvements

### Short Term:
- [ ] Add proper error handling to the Node.js app
- [ ] Implement Prometheus metrics instead of basic metrics endpoint
- [ ] Add database integration
- [ ] Improve security with secrets management

### Long Term:
- [ ] Add blue-green deployment strategy
- [ ] Implement canary deployments
- [ ] Add more comprehensive monitoring
- [ ] Create multi-environment setup (dev/staging/prod)

## Resources That Helped

### Documentation:
- AWS EKS Documentation
- Terraform AWS Provider docs
- Kubernetes official docs
- GitHub Actions documentation

### Tutorials:
- AWS EKS getting started guide
- Terraform learn tutorials
- Docker best practices
- Kubernetes basics

### Community:
- Stack Overflow for troubleshooting
- AWS Forums for service-specific questions
- GitHub issues for tool-specific problems

## Final Thoughts

This was a challenging but rewarding project! I went from knowing almost nothing about DevOps to having a working, production-ready pipeline. The learning curve was steep, but breaking it down into manageable pieces helped.

The most valuable lesson was understanding how all these tools work together - it's not just about individual technologies, but how they integrate to create a complete system.

I'm proud of what I accomplished in 3 days, and I feel much more confident about DevOps concepts now.
